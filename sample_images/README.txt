Football Position Image Collection Guide

1. Create four folders inside sample_images:
   - Defender
   - Midfielder
   - Forward
   - Goalkeeper

2. Collect or create at least 20 images per folder. You can use:
   - Diagrams from Google Images (search for 'football defender position diagram', etc.)
   - Simple diagrams you create in PowerPoint, Canva, or similar tools
   - Labeled photos of players in each position

3. Save images as PNG or JPG files (e.g., defender1.png, midfielder2.jpg, etc.)

4. Example structure:
   sample_images/
       Defender/
           defender1.png
           ...
       Midfielder/
           midfielder1.png
           ...
       Forward/
           forward1.png
           ...
       Goalkeeper/
           goalkeeper1.png
           ...
